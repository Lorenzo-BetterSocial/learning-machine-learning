# Socrates, a recommendation algorithm

Socrates: a machine learning algorithm for learning and developing open minded people


## Summary

We want to create a machine learning algorithm for recommendation content that help people to discover **new, good, different, inspiring, beautiful things.**
An algorithm that doesn't reinforce cognitive bias, but help people to create a different vision of the world, based on different point of view, true sources, comparison, exploration. Inspired by personal (internal) growth and good and beautiful research.

## Background

Too many times recommendation algorithm are based on wrong principles:

* recommend items to let you you spend more
* reinforce your bias (to let you read more)

I think these problems are widespread in all the most famous machine learning algorithm (amazon, facebook, google).
It's very urgent to update these algorithm to avoid standardization in thinking, homologation and decreasing of analysis capabilities and well-reasoned personal opinions.


## How is it used?

We think that the solution should be based on these principles:

* allow active interaction with elements "weight" in the algorithm (something as: we think these criteria "crime story" fits your interests, should we give this criteria more or less importance?), so that we calibrate "weight" with the explicit consent and help of people, this algorithm will influence.
* divergent thinking: we need to help people "considering other points of view". We should recommend sometimes contect far from the core of people's interest. Maybe we can use the "hill climbing method" setting a high level of temperature to show people content they are not familiar with.
* learning from experts: we should recommend content based on trustworthy sources. We should ask experts of relevant sectors to share data with us so as to use the function "experts of the field recommend..."
* we should let think sociologists, psychologists, machine learning engineerings, and so on about what criteria are the best to create a recommendation algorithm inspired by personal human growth and researching the best for the person who uses it.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data should be collected inside the app where the algorithm runs.
We should connect data across the user's accounts.
We should use some open database and crowl the internet (to collect "experts opinions")


## Challenges

This algorithm does not solve the "usage" of what people do with such a powerful algorithm.
We should use this algorithm only openly, people should access a dashboard and see all the criteria the algorithm uses and how.
In all fields there are some "stupid or dangerous idea" (the heart is flat, for example). We should disingorage the spread of this idea without limit personal freedom. This balance is difficult to find.
Maybe we should give some advice as "are you sure about that? Experts say...or your friend X thinks that...showing the opposite idea". To let people reflect better on that topic.


## What next?

To start developing this idea we should find a field to test it. Maybe some apps that use recommendation algorithm. 
We should define a more detailed theory of the "good and well algorithm", putting together a team of psychologists, sociologists, engineerings, and so on to sum up the criteria to test.
We should study the actual recommendation algorithm.
We should define the technical ways to apply our new criteria.
We should create and test the algorithm.

Any help will be appreciated.
