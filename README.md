# Project Title

Socrate: a machine learning algorithm for learning and developing open minded people


## Summary

We want to create a machine learning algorithm for recommendation content that help people to discover **new, good, different, inspiring, beautiful things.**
An algorithm that doesn't reninforce congnitive bias, but help people to create a different vision of the world, based on different point of view, true sources, comparison, exploration. Inspired by personal (internal) growth and good and beutiful research.

## Background

Too many times recommendation algorithm are based on wrong principles:

* recommend items to let you you spend more
* reinforce your bias (to let you read more)

I think these problems are widespread in all the most famous machine learning algorithm (amazon, facebook, google).
It's very urgent to update these algorithm to avoid standardization in thinking, homologation and decreasing of analysis capapilities and well-reasoned personal opinions.


## How is it used?

We think that the solution should be based on these principles:

* allow active interaction with elements "weight" in the algorithm (something as: we think these criteria "crime story" fits your interests, shold we give this criteria more or less importance?), so that we calibrate "weight" with the esplicit consent and help of people, this algorithm will influences.
* divergent thinking: we need to help people "considering other point of view". We should recommend somethimes contect far from the core of people interest. Maybe we can use the "hill climbing method" setting a high level of temperature to show people content they are not familiar with.
* learning from experts: we should recommend content based on trustworthy source. We should ask experts of relevant sector to share data with us so to use the function "experts of the field recommend..."
* we should let think sociologiest, pycologhist, machine learning engenieering, and so on about what criteria are the best to create di recommendation algorithm inspiring by personal growth and researching the best for the person who use it.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data should be collected inside the app where the algorithm runs.
We shold connect date cross the user accounts.
We should use some open database and crowl the internet (to collect "experts opinions")


## Challenges

This algorithm do not solve the "usage" of what people do with a such powerful algorithm.
We should use this algorithm only openly, people should access a dashboard and see all the criteria the algorithm uses and how.
In all fields there are some "stupid or dangerous idea" (the heart is flat, for example). We should disingorage the spread of this idea without limit personal freedom. This balance is difficult to find.
Maybe we should give some advice as "are you sure about that? Experts says...or your friend X think that...showing the opposit idea". To let people reflect better on that topic.


## What next?

To start developing this idea we should find a field to test it. Maybe some app that use recommendation algorithm. 
We should define a more detailed theory of the "good and well algorithm", putting toghert a team of psycologist, sociologist, engeneering, and so on to sum up the criteria to test.
We should study the actual recommendation algorithm.
We should define the tecnichal wa to apply our new criteria.
We should create and test the algorithm.

Any help will be appreciated.
