# Project Title

Socrate: a machine learning algorithm for learning and developing open mind people

## Summary

We want to create a machine learning algorithm for recommendation content that help people to discover new, good, different, inspiring, beautiful things.
An algorithm that doesn't reninforce congnitive bias, but help people to create a different vision of the world, based on different point of view, true sources, comparison, exploration. Inspired by personal (internal) growth and good and beutiful research.

## Background

Too many times recommendation algorithm are based on wrong principles:

* recommend items to let you you spend more
* reinforce your bias (to let you read more)

I think these problems are widespread in all the most famous machine learning algorithm (amazon, facebook, google).
It's very urgent to update these algorithm to avoid standardization in thinking, homologation and decreasing of analysis capapilities and well-reasoned personal opinions.

## How is it used?

We think that the solution should be based on these principles:

* allow active interaction with elements "weight" in the algorithm (something as: we think these criteria "crime story" fits your interests, shold we give this criteria more or less importance?), so that we calibrate "weight" with the esplicit consent and help of people, this algorithm will influences.
* divergent thinking: we need to help people "considering other point of view". We should recommend somethimes contect far from the core of people interest. Maybe we can use the "hill climbing method" setting a high level of temperature to show people content they are not familiar with.
* learning from experts: we should recommend content based on trustworthy source. We should ask experts of relevant sector to share data with us so to use the function "experts of the field recommend..."
* we should let think sociologiest, pycologhist, machine learning engenieering, and so on about what criteria are the best to create di recommendation algorithm inspiring by personal growth and researching the best for the person who use it.

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
